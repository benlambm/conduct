    <h1>Student Code of Conduct</h1>

    <h2>Classroom Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always treat others professionally and respectfully; no harassing, cheating, soliciting, or intimidating
            behavior.</li>
        <li>Only service animals are allowed in classrooms.</li>
        <li>No guests in class, including children; only enrolled students may attend.</li>
        <li>No playing personal audio/video or private games during class.</li>
        <li>Phones and wearables must be on silent; notify me before class if you anticipate an urgent call and step
            outside
            to take it.</li>
        <li>No disruptive acts (e.g., chronic off-topic interruptions or side-conversations, or any others behaviors
            that
            disrupt the learning environment for others).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No cheating or unauthorized assistance on any academic work (e.g., having someone else complete work for
            you).</li>
        <li>Midterm and final exams are always closed-resource: no AI tools, peers, or external websites can be
            consulted while taking an exam. This does not apply to non-exam assessments/assignments.
        </li>
        <li>Do not reuse the same or substantially similar work from another course here without written permission from
            all instructors involved.</li>
        <li>Do not publicly post or distribute instructor-created/led materials, assessments, recordings, or content
            without permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Computers and Facilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use classroom/lab computers and the campus network only for academic work during class.</li>
        <li>No smoking/vaping in college facilities.</li>
        <li>No attempts to bypass security or violate IT acceptable-use/security policies.</li>
        <li>No theft or tampering with safety equipment; respect college and personal property.</li>
    </ul>
