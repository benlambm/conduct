    <h1>Student Code of Conduct</h1>

    <h2>Classroom Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Treat others professionally and courteously; no harassing, soliciting, stealing, or intimidating
            behavior.</li>
        <li>Be on time and prepared for class. Plan to arrive a few minutes early to be ready to start on time.</li>
        <li> Attendance and participation are required. If you do
            not
            attend/participate at all during the first 15% of the course, the course will be dropped from your
            schedule. You may miss up to 20% of the course (2 classes) without penalty; missed in-class
            assignments may
            still need to be completed. Exceeding the 2-class absence limit before 60% of the course results in
            a W; at
            or after 60%, 3 or more absences result in an F. Absences for military duty, jury duty, ADA/Title IX
            circumstances, or recognized religious holidays do not count toward the 20% limit.</li>
        <li>Please no playing of personal audio/video or games during class.</li>
        <li>Phones and wearables must be on silent. Notify me before class if you anticipate an urgent call and step
            outside to take it.</li>
        <li>No disruptive behaviors, including chronic off-topic interruptions, side-conversations, or behaviors
            that disrupt the learning environment for others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Academic Integrity Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No cheating (unauthorized assistance) on any academic work; for example, having someone else complete work
            for you.
        </li>
        <li>Assume that Midterm and Final Exams are always closed-resource: no AI tools, peers, or external websites can
            be consulted while taking an Exam.
        </li>
        <li>Self-plagiarism: Do not reuse the same or substantially similar work from another course here without
            written permission from all instructors involved.</li>
        <li>Do not publicly post or peer distribute instructor-created/led materials, assessments, recordings, or
            content without permission.</li>
        <li>In case of Academic Misconduct issues, you will be notified by your VCCS e-mail and required to make-up the
            assignment. If it reoccurs, a score of 0 will be given, it will be documented/written-up, and the Academic
            Misconduct due process will occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Computers and Facilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use of classroom/lab computers and software is for academic work only. No personal use during class.</li>
        <li>Do not install or run unauthorized software on campus computers. Do not change computer settings or attempt
            to bypass security policies.</li>
        <li>Acceptable Use Policy: When using college computers in campus labs or classrooms, users are required to
            adhere to the VCCS Computer Ethics Policy and Brightpoint Acceptable Use Policy. </li>
        <li>No smoking/vaping in college facilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>College Policies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The only animals allowed in classrooms are Service animals.</li>
        <li>Only enrolled students may attend class. No guests in class. This class is not suitable for children.</li>
        <li>Title IX Reporting: As a faculty member, I am a Responsible Employee. If I observe
            or you
            disclose sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking, I am required by policy
            and
            federal law to report it to the BCC Title IX Coordinator.</li>
        <li>Disability Accommodations: If you need academic accommodations due to a disability,
            please
            work with the college's Student Accessibility Services office. They will provide official
            notification of
            any approved accommodations for this course.</li>
    </ul>
    <footer>
        Approved accommodations may apply. Violations may be addressed under the VCCS Student Code of Conduct and/or
        Academic Integrity processes.
